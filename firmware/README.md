# ‡§µ‡•á‡§ó Drone Firmware

This folder contains the Arduino-based firmware for the **‡§µ‡•á‡§ó (Veg)** Surveillance Quadcopter. The firmware is written to support both PID and LQR control strategies, along with a modular structure for Fault Detection and Identification (FDI).

## üîß Files Overview

- `veg_attitude_controller_lqr.ino`  
  Inner-loop LQR controller for stabilizing roll and pitch using a linearized model. Suitable for fast, precise control.
  
- `veg_attitude_controller_pid.ino`  
  Classical PID controller version for roll, pitch, yaw, and altitude. Simple and reliable.

- `veg_main_flight_loop.ino`  
  Unified flight loop that allows switching between PID and LQR. It includes basic FDI hooks and control execution logic.

## üß† Switching Control Modes

To switch between **LQR** and **PID** control in `veg_main_flight_loop.ino`, locate the following line:

```cpp
int control_mode = CONTROL_MODE_LQR; // or CONTROL_MODE_PID
```

Change `CONTROL_MODE_LQR` to `CONTROL_MODE_PID` if you want to use the PID controller.

## üì≤ Communication with Raspberry Pi

- The Arduino receives setpoints over serial via a formatted line:  
  ```
  SET <roll> <pitch> <yaw> <altitude>
  ```
  Example: `SET 5.0 -3.0 0.0 1.2`

- It sends back logs and FDI alerts (e.g., ‚ÄúFDI: Potential motor anomaly detected.‚Äù) via Serial.println for debugging.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup

- MPU6050 IMU via I2C
- 4 PWM-capable motor outputs:
  - Motor 1 ‚Üí D3
  - Motor 2 ‚Üí D5
  - Motor 3 ‚Üí D6
  - Motor 4 ‚Üí D9

Ensure the PWM frequency and ESC range is compatible with your motor controllers.

## üß™ Notes

- LQR gains are pre-tuned and may need adjustment per frame/inertia.
- PID gains are conservative to avoid overshoot.
- Altitude control is basic (constant placeholder). Consider adding a barometer or ultrasonic sensor for height feedback.
