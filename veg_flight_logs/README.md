## ðŸ“Œ Instructions for Use

- Clone or download the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AbhishekTyagi404/veg-slam-drone.git
  cd veg-slam-drone/veg_flight_logs
  ```

- The `.csv` and `.json` files are ready for parsing with Python, MATLAB, or any analysis tool.
- `veg_mission_01.csv` columns include:
  ```
  [time_s, latitude, longitude, altitude_m, roll_deg, pitch_deg, yaw_deg, motor1_pwm, motor2_pwm, motor3_pwm, motor4_pwm]
  ```

- For visual verification:
  - Use `veg_mission_01_plot.png` to observe planned vs actual SLAM path.
  - Use `cpu_load_plot.png` to validate Raspberry Pi 4 performance during simultaneous navigation and onboard inference.

## ðŸ”§ Reproducibility

These logs correspond to:

- 60-second simulated flight in a grid maze
- ORB-SLAM3 running on Raspberry Pi 4 in monocular-inertial mode
- LQR controller active during roll and pitch attitude stabilization
- Emergency landing triggered by rotor failure at t = 30 s
